### 测试金字塔实战
> The Practical Test Pyramid

“测试金字塔”是一个比喻，它告诉我们要把软件测试按照不同粒度来分组。它也给出了在这些分组中每个组应该有多少测试的看法。虽然测试金字塔的概念已经存在了一段时间，但一些团队仍然很难正确将它投入实践。本文重新审视“测试金字塔”最初的概念，并展示如何将其付诸实践。它展示了你应该在金字塔的不同层次上寻找何种类型的测试，并给出了如何实现这些测试的实例。

> The "Test Pyramid" is a metaphor that tells us to group software tests into buckets of different granularity. It also gives an idea of how many tests we should have in each of these groups. Although the concept of the Test Pyramid has been around for a while, teams still struggle to put it into practice properly. This article revisits the original concept of the Test Pyramid and shows how you can put this into practice. It shows which kinds of tests you should be looking for in the different levels of the pyramid and gives practical examples on how these can be implemented.

准备上生产环境的软件在上生产之前需要进行测试。随着软件开发行业的成熟，软件测试方法也日趋成熟。开发团队正在逐渐自动化大部分的测试，而不是依赖于大量的测试人员来进行手工测试。通过自动化测试，开发团队可以几秒钟就知道他们的软件是否被破坏，而不是几天后才知道。

> Production-ready software requires testing before it goes into production. As the discipline of software development matured, software testing approaches have matured too. Instead of having myriads of manual software testers development teams have moved towards automating the biggest portion of their testing efforts. Automating your test efforts allows teams to know whether their software is broken in a matter of seconds and minutes instead of days and weeks.

自动化测试极大地缩短了反馈周期，这与敏捷开发实践、持续集成、DevOps 文化等是一脉相承的。拥有高效的软件测试方法，可以让你的团队快速而自信地前行。

> The drastically shortened feedback loop fuelled by automated tests goes hand in hand with agile development practices, continuous delivery and DevOps culture. Having an effective software testing approach allows your team to move fast and confidently.

本文将探讨一个具备高响应力的、可靠并且可维护的测试组合应该如何构建，这与你具体构建的是一个微服务架构、移动应用程序或者物联网生态系统都无关。此外，我们还将详细介绍如何写出高效且可读的自动化测试。

> This article explores what a well-rounded test portfolio should look like to be responsive, reliable and maintainable - regardless of whether you're building a microservices architecture, mobile apps or IoT ecosystems. We'll also get into the details of building effective and readable automated tests.

## （测试）自动化的重要性

软件已经成为我们日常生活中的一个重要组成部分。早期它仅仅用于提高企业的效率，但如今它的作用远不止如此。如今许多公司都想方设法成为一流的数字化公司。作为用户，我们每天使用的软件越来越多。创新的车轮正越转越快。

> Software has become an essential part of the world we live in. It has outgrown its early sole purpose of making businesses more efficient. Today companies try to find ways to become first-class digital companies. As users everyone of us interacts with an ever-increasing amount of software every day. The wheels of innovation are turning faster.

如果你想跟上时代的步伐，你必须研究如何在不牺牲质量的情况下更快地交付你的软件。持续交付——一种高度自动化的、确保你可以随时将软件发布到生产环境中的实践——正能帮你达到这个目的。它也可以通过构建流水线自动测试你的软件并将其部署到测试和生产环境中。

> If you want to keep pace you'll have to look into ways to deliver your software faster without sacrificing its quality. Continuous delivery, a practice where you automatically ensure that your software can be released into production any time, can help you with that. With continuous delivery you use a build pipeline to automatically test your software and deploy it to your testing and production environments.

软件的数量正以前所未有的速度增长，如果还是手动进行构建、测试和部署，很快就会变得不可能了——除非你想把所有的时间都用来进行手动重复的工作，而不是用来开发可工作的软件。将一切自动化——从构建到测试，从部署到基础架构——是你唯一的出路。

> Building, testing and deploying an ever-increasing amount of software manually soon becomes impossible — unless you want to spend all your time with manual, repetitive work instead of delivering working software. Automating everything — from build to tests, deployment and infrastructure — is your only way forward.

![图1](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid/buildPipeline.png)

*图1：使用构建流水线来自动并可靠地将你的软件部署到生产环境*

> Figure 1: Use build pipelines to automatically and reliably get your software into production

传统的软件测试过于依赖手工操作：你首先将应用程序部署到测试环境后，然后执行一些黑盒测试，例如，通过点击用户界面来查看一切是否工作如常。通常这些测试将由文档指定，以确保测试人员每次测试的内容是一致的。

> Traditionally software testing was overly manual work done by deploying your application to a test environment and then performing some black-box style testing e.g. by clicking through your user interface to see if anything's broken. Often these tests would be specified by test scripts to ensure the testers would do consistent checking.

很明显，手动测试所有更改非常耗时、重复而且繁琐。重复很无趣，无趣就容易犯错，这样还没测到周末结束你就会想找下一份工作了。

> It's obvious that testing all changes manually is time-consuming, repetitive and tedious. Repetitive is boring, boring leads to mistakes and makes you look for a different job by the end of the week.

幸运的是，重复性劳动还是有药可治的：自动化。

> Luckily there's a remedy for repetitive tasks: automation.

自动化繁琐重复的测试将给软件开发人员的生活带来重大改变。自动化这些测试后，你就不需要再一味遵循测试文档点点点以确保软件是否仍正常工作。自动化这些测试，你可以充满自信地修改你的代码。如果你曾试过在没有适当自动化测试的情况下进行大规模的重构，那你应该知道这种体验多么恐怖。你怎么知道你有否意外地破坏了某些功能呢？显然，你需要将所有的测试用例手动点一遍。不过老实说，你真的享受这个过程吗？你想象一下，如果你对代码做了大规模改动后惬意地喝了一口咖啡，喝完咖啡后你能马上得知你的改动有没有破坏原有功能。这样的开发体验是不是听起来就让人舒服多了？

> Automating your repetitive tests can be a big game changer in your life as a software developer. Automate these tests and you no longer have to mindlessly follow click protocols in order to check if your software still works correctly. Automate your tests and you can change your codebase without batting an eye. If you've ever tried doing a large-scale refactoring without a proper test suite I bet you know what a terrifying experience this can be. How would you know if you accidentally broke stuff along the way? Well, you click through all your manual test cases, that's how. But let's be honest: do you really enjoy that? How about making even large-scale changes and knowing whether you broke stuff within seconds while taking a nice sip of coffee? Sounds more enjoyable if you ask me.

## 测试金字塔

如果你真的想为你的软件构建自动化测试，你必须知道一个关键的概念：测试金字塔。Mike Cohn在他的着作《Succeeding with Agile》一书中提出了这个概念。这个比喻非常形象，它让你一眼就知道测试是需要分层的。它还告诉你每一层需要写多少测试。

> If you want to get serious about automated tests for your software there is one key concept you should know about: the test pyramid. Mike Cohn came up with this concept in his book Succeeding with Agile. It's a great visual metaphor telling you to think about different layers of testing. It also tells you how much testing to do on each layer.

![图2](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid/testPyramid.png)

*图2：测试金字塔*

根据Mike Cohn的测试金字塔，你的测试组合应该由以下三层组成（自下往上分别是）：

- 单元测试
- 服务测试
- 用户界面测试

> Mike Cohn's original test pyramid consists of three layers that your test suite should consist of (bottom to top):

> - Unit Tests
> - Service Tests
> - User Interface Tests

不幸的是，如果你仔细思考就会发现，测试金字塔的概念有点太短了。有人认为，Mike Cohn的测试金字塔里的命名或某些概念不是最理想的。我也同意这一点。从当今的角度来看，测试金字塔似乎过于简单了，因此可能会产生误导。

> Unfortunately the concept of the test pyramid falls a little short if you take a closer look. Some argue that either the naming or some conceptual aspects of Mike Cohn's test pyramid are not ideal, and I have to agree. From a modern point of view the test pyramid seems overly simplistic and can therefore be misleading.

然而，由于其简洁性，在建立你自己的测试组合时，测试金字塔本身是一条很好的经验法则。你最好是记住Cohn测试金字塔中提到的两件事：

- 编写不同粒度的测试
- 层次越高，你写的测试应该越少

> Still, due to it's simplicity the essence of the test pyramid serves as a good rule of thumb when it comes to establishing your own test suite. Your best bet is to remember two things from Cohn's original test pyramid:

> - Write tests with different granularity
> - The more high-level you get the fewer tests you should have

为了维持金字塔形状，一个健康、快速、可维护的测试组合应该是这样的：写许多小而快的单元测试。适当写一些更粗粒度的测试，写很少高层次的端到端测试。注意不要让你的测试变成[冰淇淋](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/introducing-software-testing-cupcake-anti-pattern)那样子，这对维护来说将是一个噩梦，并且跑一遍也需要太多时间。

> Stick to the pyramid shape to come up with a healthy, fast and maintainable test suite: Write lots of small and fast unit tests. Write some more coarse-grained tests and very few high-level tests that test your application from end to end. Watch out that you don't end up with a test ice-cream cone that will be a nightmare to maintain and takes way too long to run.

不要太拘泥于Cohn测试金字塔中各层次的名字。事实上，它们可能相当具有误导性：服务测试是一个难以掌握的术语（Cohn本人说他观察到[很多开发人员完全忽略了这一层](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-forgotten-layer-of-the-test-automation-pyramid)）。在单页应用框架（如react，angular，ember.js等）的时代，UI测试显然不必位于金字塔的最高层，你完全能够用这些框架对UI进行单元测试。

> Don't become too attached to the names of the individual layers in Cohn's test pyramid. In fact they can be quite misleading: service test is a term that is hard to grasp (Cohn himself talks about the observation that a lot of developers completely ignore this layer). In the days of single page application frameworks like react, angular, ember.js and others it becomes apparent that UI tests don't have to be on the highest level of your pyramid - you're perfectly able to unit test your UI in all of these frameworks.

考虑到原始名称的缺点，只要在你的代码库和团队讨论中达成一致，你完全可以为测试层次提供其他名称。

> Given the shortcomings of the original names it's totally okay to come up with other names for your test layers, as long as you keep it consistent within your codebase and your team's discussions.

## 示例应用

我已经写好了一个[简单的微服务应用](https://github.com/hamvocke/spring-testing)，其中涵盖了测试金字塔各种层次的测试。

> I've written a simple microservice including a test suite with tests for the different layers of the test pyramid.

示例应用体现了一个典型的微服务的特点。它提供了一个REST接口，与数据库进行通信并从第三方REST服务中获取信息。它是使用Spring Boot实现的，即使你之前从未使用过Spring Boot，它也简单到应该可以理解。

> The sample application shows traits of a typical microservice. It provides a REST interface, talks to a database and fetches information from a third-party REST service. It's implemented in Spring Boot and should be understandable even if you've never worked with Spring Boot before.

请下载Github上的代码。Readme里写了你在计算机上运行应用程序及其自动化测试所需的说明。

> Make sure to check out the code on Github. The readme contains instructions you need to run the application and its automated tests on your machine.

##### 功能

应用的功能十分简单。它提供了三个REST接口：

- ```GET /hello```	总是返回"Hello World"
	 ```GET /hello/{lastname}```	根据lastname来查询人，如果查到了结果将返回"Hello {Firstname} {Lastname}"
	 ```GET /weather```	返回现在德国汉堡的天气情况

> The application's functionality is simple. It provides a REST interface with three endpoints:

> - ```GET /hello```	Returns "Hello World". Always.
> 	 ```GET /hello/{lastname}```	Looks up the person with the provided last name. If the person is known, returns "Hello {Firstname} {Lastname}".
> 	 ```GET /weather```	Returns the current weather conditions for Hamburg, Germany.

##### 高层架构

从高层次来看，这个系统的结构是这样：

> On a high-level the system has the following structure:

![图3](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid/testService.png)

*图3：我们微服务系统的高层架构*

我们的微服务提供了一个可以通过HTTP调用的REST接口。对于某些接口，服务将从数据库获取信息。在其他情况下，服务将通过HTTP调用外部[天气API](https://darksky.net/forecast/40.7127,-74.0059/us12/en)来获取并显示当前天气状况。

> Our microservice provides a REST interface that can be called via HTTP. For some endpoints the service will fetch information from a database. In other cases the service will call an external weather API via HTTP to fetch and display current weather conditions.

##### 内部架构

在内部，Spring Service有一个典型的Spring架构：

> Internally, the Spring Service has a Spring-typical architecture:

![图4](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid/testArchitecture.png)

*图4：我们微服务的内部架构*

- ```Controller``` 提供REST接口，处理HTTP请求和响应
- ```Repository``` 和数据库打交道，关注数据在持久化存储里的读写操作
- ```Client``` 和别的API交互，在我们的应用里它会通过HTTPS从darksky.net获取天气情况
- ```Domain``` 这是我们的[领域模型](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_model)，它包含了领域逻辑（相对来说，在我们的示例中不甚重要）

> - ```Controller``` classes provide REST endpoints and deal with HTTP requests and responses
> - ```Repository``` classes interface with the database and take care of writing and reading data to/from persistent storage
> - ```Client``` classes talk to other APIs, in our case it fetches JSON via HTTPS from the darksky.net weather API
> - ```Domain``` classes capture our [domain model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_model) including the domain logic (which, to be fair, is quite trivial in our case).

有经验的Spring开发人员可能会注意到这里缺失了一个常用的层次：受[Domain-Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)的启发，很多开发人员通常会构建一个由服务类组成的服务层。我决定不在这个应用中包含服务层。原因之一是我们的应用程序很简单，服务层只会成为一个不必要的中间层。另一个是我认为人们过度使用服务层。我经常遇到在服务类中写了全部业务逻辑的代码库。领域模型仅仅成为数据层，而不是行为（[贫血域模型](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemic_domain_model)）。对于每一个稍有复杂度的应用来说，这浪费了很多让代码保持结构良好且易于测试的优秀方案，并且没能充分利用面向对象的威力。

> Experienced Spring developers might notice that a frequently used layer is missing here: Inspired by Domain-Driven Design a lot of developers build a service layer consisting of service classes. I decided not to include a service layer in this application. One reason is that our application is simple enough, a service layer would have been an unnecessary level of indirection. The other one is that I think people overdo it with service layers. I often encounter codebases where the entire business logic is captured within service classes. The domain model becomes merely a layer for data, not for behaviour (an Anemic Domain Model). For every non-trivial application this wastes a lot of potential to keep your code well-structured and testable and does not fully utilise the power of object orientation.

我们的repositories非常简单，它提供简单的CRUD功能。为了保持代码简单，我使用了Spring Data。 Spring Data为我们提供了一个简单而通用的CRUD实现，我们可以直接使用而不需再造轮子。它还负责为我们的测试启动一个内存数据库，而不是像生产中一样使用真正的PostgreSQL数据库。

> Our repositories are straightforward and provide simple CRUD functionality. To keep the code simple I used Spring Data. Spring Data gives us a simple and generic CRUD repository implementation that we can use instead of rolling our own. It also takes care of spinning up an in-memory database for our tests instead of using a real PostgreSQL database as it would in production.

看看代码库，熟悉一下内部结构。这将有助于我们的下一步：测试我们的应用！

> Take a look at the codebase and make yourself familiar with the internal structure. It will be useful for our next step: Testing the application!

## 单元测试

> The foundation of your test suite will be made up of unit tests. Your unit tests make sure that a certain unit (your subject under test) of your codebase works as intended. Unit tests have the narrowest scope of all the tests in your test suite. The number of unit tests in your test suite will largely outnumber any other type of test.

![图5](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid/unitTest.png)

*图5：一个用测试替身隔绝了外部依赖的典型单元测试*

#### 一个单元指的是什么？

> If you ask three different people what "unit" means in the context of unit tests, you'll probably receive four different, slightly nuanced answers. To a certain extent it's a matter of your own definition and it's okay to have no canonical answer.

> If you're working in a functional language a unit will most likely be a single function. Your unit tests will call a function with different parameters and ensure that it returns the expected values. In an object-oriented language a unit can range from a single method to an entire class.

#### 群居和独居

> Some argue that all collaborators (e.g. other classes that are called by your class under test) of your subject under test should be substituted with mocks or stubs to come up with perfect isolation and to avoid side-effects and a complicated test setup. Others argue that only collaborators that are slow or have bigger side effects (e.g. classes that access databases or make network calls) should be stubbed or mocked.

> [Occasionally](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html) people label these two sorts of tests as solitary unit tests for tests that stub all collaborators and sociable unit tests for tests that allow talking to real collaborators (Jay Fields' [Working Effectively with Unit Tests](https://leanpub.com/wewut) coined these terms). If you have some spare time you can go down the rabbit hole and [read more about the pros and cons](https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html) of the different schools of thought.

> At the end of the day it's not important to decide if you go for solitary or sociable unit tests. Writing automated tests is what's important. Personally, I find myself using both approaches all the time. If it becomes awkward to use real collaborators I will use mocks and stubs generously. If I feel like involving the real collaborator gives me more confidence in a test I'll only stub the outermost parts of my service.

#### Mocking and Stubbing

> Mocks and Stubs are two different kinds of Test Doubles (there are more than these two). A lot of people use the terms Mock and Stub interchangeably. I think it's good to be precise and keep their specific properties in mind. You can use test doubles to replace objects you'd use in production with an implementation that helps you with testing.

> In plain words it means that you replace a real thing (e.g. a class, module or function) with a fake version of that thing. The fake version looks and acts like the real thing (answers to the same method calls) but answers with canned responses that you define yourself at the beginning of your unit test.

> Using test doubles is not specific to unit testing. More elaborate test doubles can be used to simulate entire parts of your system in a controlled way. However, in unit testing you're most likely to encounter a lot of mocks and stubs (depending of whether you're the sociable or solitary kind of developer), simply because lots of modern languages and libraries make it easy and comfortable to set up mocks and stubs.

> Regardless of your technology choice, there's a good chance that either your language's standard library or some popular third-party library will provide you with elegant ways to set up mocks. And even writing your own mocks from scratch is only a matter of writing a fake class/module/function with the same signature as the real one and setting up the fake in your test.
 
> Your unit tests will run very fast. On a decent machine you can expect to run thousands of unit tests within a few minutes. Test small pieces of your codebase in isolation and avoid hitting databases, the filesystem or firing HTTP queries (by using mocks and stubs for these parts) to keep your tests fast.

> Once you got a hang of writing unit tests you will become more and more fluent in writing them. Stub out external collaborators, set up some input data, call your subject under test and check that the returned value is what you expected. Look into [Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and let your unit tests guide your development; if applied correctly it can help you get into a great flow and come up with a good and maintainable design while automatically producing a comprehensive and fully automated test suite. Still, it's no silver bullet. Go ahead, give it a real chance and see if it feels right for you.

#### 应该测试什么？

> The good thing about unit tests is that you can write them for all your production code classes, regardless of their functionality or which layer in your internal structure they belong to. You can unit tests controllers just like you can unit test repositories, domain classes or file readers. Simply stick to the **one test class per production class** rule of thumb and you're off to a good start.

> A unit test class should at least **test the public interface of the class**. Private methods can't be tested anyways since you simply can't call them from a different test class. Protected or package-private are accessible from a test class (given the package structure of your test class is the same as with the production class) but testing these methods could already go too far.

> There's a fine line when it comes to writing unit tests: They should ensure that all your non-trivial code paths are tested (including happy path and edge cases). At the same time they shouldn't be tied to your implementation too closely.

> Why's that?

> Tests that are too close to the production code quickly become annoying. As soon as you refactor your production code (quick recap: refactoring means changing the internal structure of your code without changing the externally visible behaviour) your unit tests will break.

> This way you lose one big benefit of unit tests: acting as a safety net for code changes. You rather become fed up with those stupid tests failing every time you refactor, causing more work than being helpful; and whose idea was this stupid testing stuff anyways?

> What do you do instead? Don't reflect your internal code structure within your unit tests. Test for observable behaviour instead. Think about

> *if I enter values x and y, will the result be z?*

> instead of

> *if I enter x and y, will the method call class A first, then call class B and then return the result of class A plus the result of class B?*

> Private methods should generally be considered an implementation detail. That's why you shouldn't even have the urge to test them.

> I often hear opponents of unit testing (or TDD ) arguing that writing unit tests becomes pointless work where you have to test all your methods in order to come up with a high test coverage. They often cite scenarios where an overly eager team lead forced them to write unit tests for getters and setters and all other sorts of trivial code in order to come up with 100% test coverage.

> There's so much wrong with that.

> Yes, you should test the public interface. More importantly, however, you **don't test trivial code**. Don't worry, [Kent Beck said it's ok](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/153234/how-deep-are-your-unit-tests/). You won't gain anything from testing simple getters or setters or other trivial implementations (e.g. without any conditional logic). Save the time, that's one more meeting you can attend, hooray!

#### 测试结构

> A good structure for all your tests (this is not limited to unit tests) is this one:

> 1.Set up the test data

> 2.Call your method under test

> 3.Assert that the expected results are returned

> There's a nice mnemonic to remember this structure: ["Arrange, Act, Assert"](https://xp123.com/articles/3a-arrange-act-assert/). Another one that you can use takes inspiration from BDD . It's the ["given", "when", "then"](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html) triad, where given reflects the setup, when the method call and then the assertion part.

> This pattern can be applied to other, more high-level tests as well. In every case they ensure that your tests remain easy and consistent to read. On top of that tests written with this structure in mind tend to be shorter and more expressive.

#### 实现一个单元测试

> Now that we know what to test and how to structure our unit tests we can finally see a real example.

> Let's take a simplified version of the ExampleController class:

```java
@RestController
public class ExampleController {

    private final PersonRepository personRepo;

    @Autowired
    public ExampleController(final PersonRepository personRepo) {
        this.personRepo = personRepo;
    }

    @GetMapping("/hello/{lastName}")
    public String hello(@PathVariable final String lastName) {
        Optional<Person> foundPerson = personRepo.findByLastName(lastName);

        return foundPerson
                .map(person -> String.format("Hello %s %s!",
                        person.getFirstName(),
                        person.getLastName()))
                .orElse(String.format("Who is this '%s' you're talking about?",
                        lastName));
    }
}
```

> A unit test for the hello(lastname) method could look like this:

```java
public class ExampleControllerTest {

    private ExampleController subject;

    @Mock
    private PersonRepository personRepo;

    @Before
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        initMocks(this);
        subject = new ExampleController(personRepo);
    }

    @Test
    public void shouldReturnFullNameOfAPerson() throws Exception {
        Person peter = new Person("Peter", "Pan");
        given(personRepo.findByLastName("Pan"))
            .willReturn(Optional.of(peter));

        String greeting = subject.hello("Pan");

        assertThat(greeting, is("Hello Peter Pan!"));
    }

    @Test
    public void shouldTellIfPersonIsUnknown() throws Exception {
        given(personRepo.findByLastName(anyString()))
            .willReturn(Optional.empty());

        String greeting = subject.hello("Pan");

        assertThat(greeting, is("Who is this 'Pan' you're talking about?"));
    }
}
```

> We're writing the unit tests using [JUnit](http://junit.org/), the de-facto standard testing framework for Java. We use [Mockito](http://site.mockito.org/) to replace the real PersonRepository class with a stub for our test. This stub allows us to define canned responses the stubbed method should return in this test. Stubbing makes our test more simple, predictable and allows us to easily setup test data.

> Following the arrange, act, assert structure, we write two unit tests - a positive case and a case where the searched person cannot be found. The first, positive test case creates a new person object and tells the mocked repository to return this object when it's called with "Pan" as the value for the lastName parameter. The test then goes on to call the method that should be tested. Finally it asserts that the response is equal to the expected response.

> The second test works similarly but tests the scenario where the tested method does not find a person for the given parameter.
